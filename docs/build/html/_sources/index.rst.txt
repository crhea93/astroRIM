Welcome to astroRIM's documentation!
====================================


astroRIM is an easy-to-modify python module that enables users to employ the recurrent inference machine (RIM) for 1D and 2D problems in a modular manner. 
Users are provided with a standard set of 1D and 2D RIM configurations and likelihood modules; however, these can readily be modified to fit the user's specific architecture.

In this documentation, you will find the outline of the methodology of the RIM. Additionally, you will be able to see the standard architectures and how
to quickly build your own. Examples include using a RIM to solve a 1D and 2D denconvolution problem.

You can find the API documentation here as well.
