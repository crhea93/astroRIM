# astroRIM
Recurrent Inference Machine for Astronomy

## What is astroRIM
astroRIM is an easy-to-modify python module that enables users to employ the recurrent inference machine (RIM) for 1D and 2D problems in a modular manner. 
Users are provided with a standard set of 1D and 2D RIM configurations and likelihood modules; however, these can readily be modified to fit the user's specific architecture (see documentation for more details).
